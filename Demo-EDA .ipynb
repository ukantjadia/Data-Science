    "- Univariate Analysis\n",
    "    - It only focuses on analyzing each attribute independently(seprately).\n",

    "            - For visulization plots like scatterplot(regression plot),2D histplot, 2D KDEplot \n",

    "            - Compare the distribution of categorical data corrosponding to different categorical data.\n",
